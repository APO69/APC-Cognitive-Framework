# APC Cognitive Framework

APC (Scope–Depth–Context) is a human-designed cognitive meta-framework
for modulating how artificial intelligence systems structure, develop,
and contextualize their responses.

APC does not modify AI models internally.
Instead, it provides an explicit, reproducible way to define
*how* an AI should reason, communicate, and adapt its output.

## What problem does APC solve?

Traditional prompting mixes style, depth, and intent in a single text instruction.
This makes results inconsistent, hard to reproduce, and difficult to compare.

APC separates these dimensions into three independent axes:
- **Scope (A):** mode of discourse (categorical)
- **Depth (P):** level of analytical development (progressive)
- **Context (C):** functional intent of the response

## Why APC is different

- It is not a prompt template.
- It is not a tuning method.
- It is a cognitive control layer designed for human use.

APC allows the same question to be answered through different cognitive configurations
using compact, explicit codes.
