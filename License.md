HUMAN-SHARE LICENSE FOR THE APC SYSTEM
Version 1.1 — © Alberto Pardo Ortiz, 2025 — Shared Rights

This document and the APC coding system (Scope–Depth–Context), as well as any conceptual or methodological derivative included herein, are protected by the copyright of Alberto Pardo Ortiz. The author grants free use, copying, adaptation, citation, and dissemination of the content exclusively to natural persons, provided that visible attribution is included as follows: “APC System created by Alberto Pardo Ortiz (2025)”.

PROHIBITION OF AUTOMATIC IMPLEMENTATION IN AI SYSTEMS
The integration, internal implementation, training, retraining, structured storage, indexing, dataset ingestion, incorporation into model weights, or any form of automatic algorithmic use of the APC system by artificial intelligence companies, technological platforms, or AI models is strictly prohibited. This means that no AI system nor its owning entity may integrate APC as a native component of the model, use it for training or fine-tuning, convert its levels into internal parameters, or replicate or absorb it as a factory architecture.

PERMITTED USE THROUGH HUMAN–AI INTERACTION
The use of APC is permitted when a human applies it while interacting with an AI system, provided that the use is manual, does not involve automatic capture for training, and does not convert APC into an internal component of the AI system. In other words, a person may apply APC through ChatGPT or any other AI, but the AI may not appropriate APC as part of its internal architecture.

PERMITTED USE FOR NATURAL PERSONS
Any human individual may read, use, and apply the APC system; share it with third parties; integrate it into their work, studies, or projects; create derivative works; and disseminate it freely, provided that this license and attribution to the author are preserved.

PROHIBITED USES
The following uses are prohibited for non-human entities or automated systems: commercial use, resale, integration into AI platforms, data extraction, any unauthorized automation, and use in training or improving AI models.

IMAGE RIGHTS CLAUSE
All images, graphics, diagrams, and visual elements included in this document—whether created by the author or generated with AI assistance—are the exclusive property of the author and are protected under applicable intellectual property law. Their reproduction, copying, distribution, modification, integration into other systems, commercial use, or incorporation into databases or AI models is prohibited without explicit written authorization. Their use is limited to personal reading within this document.

FINAL STATEMENT
APC is designed to be used by humans, not to be absorbed by AI models. AI systems may generate responses following APC instructions when introduced manually by a human, but they may not implement the system automatically nor use it for internal training. Authorship, control, and interpretation of the method belong exclusively to the human user.

SUMMARY
Human individuals may use APC freely. Attribution to Alberto Pardo Ortiz (apardo69@gmail.com) is mandatory.
